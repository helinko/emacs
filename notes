* Things to find out about emacs

** Wrapped lines
(setq-default word-wrap t) or visual-line-mode

Find a way to see wrapped lines, indicating the beginning of such line rather than every wrap. Or perhaps indicating when there are two logical lines with no empty line between them.

** Highlight current line
This became unusable with the current theme. The setting is commented out in ui.el.

** Learn org-mode
*** Note-taking
*** TODOs

** Find out how to compose commands
This might not exist on this general of a level. Perhaps to do something to 'the other window', I have to select it, do the thing and then select the original again. 

** IDO settings
How to add a file when the new name matches with an old one?

** Look into hippie-expand

** Commenting regions
Not even sure what this was about when I made the note. Perhaps separate problems in elisp and latex?

** Division of my emacs setting files
The original structure doesn't make sense for me.

** Look into backup files
These should be turned off in editing.el but there are still ~ files.

** Title bar
Not too important. I guess I need some place to drag the windows, anyways.
