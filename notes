Things to find out about emacs:

(setq-default word-wrap t) or visual-line-mode
Find a way to disable line numbers, but still see wrapped lines (and indicating the beginning rather than every wrap). 

Highlight current line (was unusable with the current theme). Setting in editing.el.

Figuring out a org-mode (bullet points and highlighting).

Are my ido settings reasonable? How to add a file when the new name matches with an old one?

Look into hippie-expand.

Commenting regions.

The way these settings are divided into files doesn't make much sense.

'Import' colors from regular shell to M-x shell.

Backup files. These are turned on in editing.el but there are still ~ files.

What to do with the title bar?
